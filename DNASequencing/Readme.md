#DNA Sequencing
####The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to build and maintain that organism. It is an organismâ€™s complete set of DNA.

DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:
A: Adenine
C: Cytosine
G: Guanine
T: Thymine

So a strand of DNA could look something like ACGAATTCCG

DNA.java is a program that determines whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA.

A protein has the following qualities:

- It begins with a "start condon": ATG
- It ends with a "stop condon": TGA
- In between, each additional condon is a sequence of three nucleotides

So for example:
- ATGCGATACTGA is a protein because it has the start condon ATG, the stop condon TGA, and the length is divisible by 3.
- ATGCGATAGA is not a protein because the sequence length is not divisible by 3, so the third condition is not satisfied.
