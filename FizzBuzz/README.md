# Fizz Buzz
#### Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

FizzBuzz.java is a program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100â€¦ with a catch:

- For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
- For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
